## About Me

Currently I am a Ph.D. student in Engineering and Applied Science School, George Washington University. I am advised by Professor [Rober B. Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/). Iâ€™m interested in deep metric learning on visual task. My current research is focused on finding visual explanation for deep metric learning on Convolutional Nerual Network.

## Research 

My research area is in Computer Vision. Finding visual explanation for deep metric learning,
